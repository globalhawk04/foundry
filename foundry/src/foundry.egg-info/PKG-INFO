# Foundry: Build Production-Grade AI Systems

**Foundry is a production-grade Python framework for building resilient, human-in-the-loop, fine-tuning data flywheels for generative AI.**

## The Problem

Building a simple AI prototype is easy. Building a robust, production-ready AI system that continuously improves is incredibly hard. Real-world AI systems face constant challenges:

*   **Imperfect Models:** Generative AI models are powerful but never 100% accurate. Their outputs require validation and correction.
*   **Fragile Pipelines:** Real-world AI tasks are multi-step processes. A failure in one step shouldn't bring down the entire system or lose valuable work.
*   **Data Ambiguity:** Sometimes, the AI doesn't have enough context to make a confident decision. Forcing it to guess leads to low-quality results.
*   **Stagnant Models:** An AI model that doesn't learn from its mistakes will never improve, leading to a frustrating user experience and high operational costs.

## The Solution: The Foundry Flywheel

Foundry provides the architectural components to solve these problems by helping you build a **data flywheel**.

1.  **Resilient Pipelines:** Structure your AI tasks as a series of resilient `Phases`. If a step fails, the pipeline pauses, preserving the work from successful prior steps.
2.  **Human-in-the-Loop:** When the system detects ambiguity, it automatically generates a `ClarificationRequest`, pausing the pipeline to ask a human for the specific information it needs.
3.  **Correction & Fine-Tuning:** All AI outputs can be reviewed by a human in a simple "Correction Deck" UI. Every correction is saved as a high-quality `CorrectionRecord`, creating a perfect dataset for fine-tuning your next-generation model.

Foundry is the toolkit you need when your AI project moves from a Jupyter Notebook to a real product.

# Installation

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- `pip` and `git`

## Installing the Package

You can install Foundry directly from the GitHub repository.

### For Production Use

It is recommended to install from a specific release tag to ensure stability.

bash
pip install git+https://github.com/your-username/foundry.git@v0.1.0

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/foundry.git
cd foundry

# 2. Install in editable mode
pip install -e .

# Core Concept: The Data Flywheel

The central idea behind Foundry is the **Data Correction & Fine-Tuning Flywheel**. It is a virtuous cycle that turns your application's daily operations into a scalable, ever-improving data generation engine.

### How it Works

1.  **Initial Process:** An initial, general-purpose AI model (or an early fine-tuned version) processes an input (e.g., an invoice image). It produces a structured but flawed output.
2.  **Human Correction:** A human operator uses Foundry's **Correction Deck** UI to quickly and easily fix the errors in the AI's output. They are not labeling from scratch; they are correcting, which is significantly faster.
3.  **Record Generation:** When the human saves their correction, Foundry creates a permanent `CorrectionRecord`. This record is a perfect, self-contained training example, containing the original `input`, the `model's flawed output`, and the `human's "ground truth" correction`.
4.  **Export & Fine-Tune:** Once you have collected a sufficient number of `CorrectionRecord`s (typically a few hundred to a few thousand), you can use the `CorrectionHandler` to export them into a standard `.jsonl` format. This file is ready to be used to fine-tune a new, improved version of your AI model using services like Vertex AI, Hugging Face, or OpenAI.
5.  **Deploy & Repeat:** The newly fine-tuned model replaces the old one. It will make fewer mistakes on the next batch of inputs, reducing the amount of human correction needed. The flywheel spins faster, and the quality of your AI and your data continuously improves.

This flywheel is the most effective way to build a powerful, domain-specific AI model that creates a competitive advantage.
